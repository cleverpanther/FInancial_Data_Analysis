### Syllabus

     Week 1 - Visualizing and Munging Stock Data
     
              Why do investment banks and consumer banks use Python to build quantitative models to predict returns and evaluate risks? 
              What makes Python one of the most popular tools for financial analysis? You are going to learn basic python to import, 
              manipulate and visualize stock data in this module. As Python is highly readable and simple enough, you can build one of 
              the most popular trading models - Trend following strategy by the end of this module!
              
              1.0 Module Introduction
              1.1 Packages for Data Analysis
              1.2 Importing data
              1.3 Basics of Dataframe
              1.4 Generate new variables in Dataframe
              1.5 Trading Strategy
     
     
     Week 2 - Random variables and distribution
              In the previous module, we built a simple trading strategy base on Moving Average 10 and 50, which are 
              "random variables" in statistics. In this module, we are going to explore basic concepts of random variables. 
              By understanding the frequency and distribution of random variables, we extend further to the discussion of 
              probability. In the later part of the module, we apply the probability concept in measuring the risk of 
              investing a stock by looking at the distribution of log daily return using python. Learners are expected 
              to have basic knowledge of probability before taking this module.
     
              2.0 Module Introduction
              2.1 Outcomes and Random Variables
              2.2 Frequency and Distributions
              2.3 Models of Distribution
     
     
     Week 3 - Sampling and Inference 
              In financial analysis, we always infer the real mean return of stocks, or equity funds, based on the historical data 
              of a couple years. This situation is in line with a core part of statistics - Statistical Inference - which we also 
              base on sample data to infer the population of a target variable.In this module, you are going to understand the basic 
              concept of statistical inference such as population, samples and random sampling. In the second part of the module, we 
              shall estimate the range of mean return of a stock using a concept called confidence interval, after we understand the
              distribution of sample mean.We will also testify the claim of investment return using another statistical concept - 
              hypothesis testing.
              
              3.0 Introduction
              3.1 Population and Sample
              3.2 Variation of Sample
              3.3 Confidence Interval
              3.4 Hypothesis Testing
     
     
     Week 4 - Linear Regression Models for Financial Analysis
              In this module, we will explore the most often used prediction method - linear regression. From learning the association 
              of random variables to simple and multiple linear regression model, we finally come to the most interesting part of this 
              course: we will build a model using multiple indices from the global markets and predict the price change of an ETF of 
              S&P500. In addition to building a stock trading model, it is also great fun to test the performance of your own models, 
              which I will also show you how to evaluate them!
              
              4.0 Introduction
              4.1 Association of random variables
              4.2 Simple linear regression model
              4.3 Diagnostic of linear regression model
              4.4 Multiple linear regression model
              4.5 Evaluate the strategy
